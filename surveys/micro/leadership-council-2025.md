# Survey questions

One of the responsibilities of the [leadership council](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/leadership-council),
formed by [RFC 3392](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/3392-leadership-council.html),
is to solicit feedback on a yearly basis from the Project on how we are performing
our duties.

> Each year, the Council must solicit feedback on whether the Council is
> serving its purpose effectively from all willing and able Project members and
> openly discuss this feedback in a forum that allows and encourages active
> participation from all Project members. To do so, the Council and other
> Project members consult the high-level duties, expectations, and constraints
> listed in this RFC and any subsequent revisions thereof to determine if the
> Council is meeting its duties and obligations.

This is a quick annual survey for Rust-lang project members to provide feedback
on the Leadership Council. Your feedback is appreciated to help steer the
Council activities. As always, if you have specific questions or feedback that
you would like to provide, feel free to reach out to any Council member with
questions.

This survey is anonymous. The Council will go through all answers and release a
summary after the survey is complete, similar to the one published
[last year](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/08/26/council-survey/).

## Leadership Council Effectiveness

For each of the key [duties] outlined in RFC 3392 (quoted below), we'd like your
input on how well the Council is performing against that duty.

You may want to (re)read the last ~year of regular updates from the Council to help build context:

* [2024 Q4](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2024/12/09/leadership-council-update/)
* [2025 Q1](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2025/03/17/leadership-council-update/)

> placement in a backlog, etc.).

> teams to own this work.
